title: What Every Programmer Should Know About Floating-Point Arithmetic
description: Aims to provide both short and simple answers to the common recurring questions of novice programmers about floating-point numbers not 'adding up' correctly, and more in-depth information about how IEEE 754 floats work, when and how to use them correctly, and what to use instead when they are not appropriate.

Why don't my numbers add up?
============================

So you've written some absurdly simple code, say for example:

		0.1 + 0.2

and got a really unexpected result:

		0.30000000000000004

Maybe you asked for help on some forum and got pointed to a [long article with lots of formulas](http://download.oracle.com/docs/cd/E19957-01/806-3568/ncg_goldberg.html) that didn't seem to help with your problem.

Well, this site is here to:

* Explain concisely why you get that unexpected result
* Tell you how to deal with this problem
* If you're interested, provide in-depth explanations of why floating-point numbers have to work like that and what other problems can arise

You should look at the [Basic Answers](/basic/) first - but don't stop there!

为什么我的数字加起来不对？
============================

比如你写了一些非常简单的代码，例如：

		0.1 + 0.2

得到了完全意外的结果：

		0.30000000000000004

你有可能在某个论坛寻求帮助，然后得到一个指向 [有很多公式的长文章](http://download.oracle.com/docs/cd/E19957-01/806-3568/ncg_goldberg.html) ，但这个结果好像并不能帮你解决问题。

好吧，本网站就是：

* 简明解释为什么你得到了意外的结果
* 告诉你怎么处理这个问题
* 如果你感兴趣，本站也提供了深入的解释来说明为什么浮点数要这样工作，还有其他一些可能出现的问题

你应该首先看 [基础答案](/basic/) - 但你不应该在那里停下来！
